The purpose of the Author Contributions Checklist (ACC) Form is to
document the code and data supporting a manuscript, and describe how to
reproduce its main results.

As of Sept. 1, 2016, the ACC Form must be included with all new
submissions to JASA A&CS.

This document is the initial version of the template that will be
provided to authors. The JASA Associate Editors for Reproducibility will
update this document with more detailed instructions and information
about best practices for many of the listed requirements over time.

Data
----

**Abstract (Mandatory)**

**Dataset provided**:

1.  Simu1Case1Data.Rdata

> Simulated Data for Case 1 – Simulation 1 (Xmat of dimension 70 X 190,
> y of length 70)

**Availability (Mandatory)**

*Restrictions (if data will not be made publicly available, justify why
not)*

None

The real data is available publicly at the following website:

http://m2g.io/

The processed real data as well as simulated datasets will be made
public eventually on the *github.com* page of the lead author.

**Description (Mandatory if data available)**

*Permissions (demonstrate that author has legitimate access to data)*

The authors have taken permission from the original data providers. In
lieu, the data providers have requested to authors to cite their related
work and the authors have done the same.

*Licensing information*

The raw data as well as processed data as finally used will be uploaded
on the *github.com* webpage of the lead author.

*File format*

The original network graphs were in the "gpickle" format (which is a
NetworkX (Python library for graph analysis) format), and have been
converted to a graphml format readable by R.

The final converted data is available in .Rdata format.

*Metadata (including data dictionary)*

The final data used by the authors consist of a predictor matrix Xmat
(dimension 79 X 2278 for real application, dimension 70 X 190 for
simulated scenario) and continuous response vector y (length 79 for real
application, length 70 for simulated scenario).

*Version information*

Not Applicable

**Optional Information (complete as necessary) **

Unique identifier / DOI

Code
----

**Abstract (Mandatory)**

1.  BNSPCodeRun.R- The code loads the data in .Rdata format (‘Xmat’ is
    the predictor and ‘y’ is the continuous response). It then sources
    the code BNSP-Function.R, which consists of a function to input data
    and parameters to run the BNSP model. Subsequently, the MCMC chain
    (using Gibbs sampler) is run for niter = 50000 iterations. Model
    performance in terms of mean squared error of edge detection and
    also probability of node detection is then calculated.

2.  BNSP-Function.R – The code contains function ‘BNSPfunc’ that inputs
    data and relevant parameters to run the BNSP model.

**Description (Mandatory)**

*How delivered (R package, Shiny app, etc.)*

The R code will be delivered as a .R file.

Licensing information (default is MIT License)

*Link to code/repository (e.g., github.com, bitbucket.org; this need not
be the actual link at time of submission but if not, it should indicate
where the code will be deposited if the manuscript is accepted)*

The code will be eventually uploaded on the *github.com* page of the
lead author.

Version information (e.g., for a Git repository, the number or
branch+commit)

Not applicable at this time.

**Optional Information (complete as necessary) **

*Hardware requirements (e.g., operating system with version number,
access to cluster, GPUs, etc.)*

*Supporting software requirements (e.g., libraries and dependencies,
including version numbers)*

R libraries used are listed in the R code supplied.

*Unique identifier/DOI*

Not applicable at this time.

Instructions for Use
--------------------

**Reproducibility (Mandatory)**

1.  BNSPCodeRun.R can be used to reproduce Figures 2 and 3; Tables 4, 5
    and 6 (Node selection probabilities) by changing the simulation
    settings. We have provided simulated data for Simulation 1 (Case 1).

**Replication (Optional)**

How to use software in other settings (or links to such information,
e.g., R package vignettes, demos or other examples)
